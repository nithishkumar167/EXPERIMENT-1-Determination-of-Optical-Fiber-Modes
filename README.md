## 📚 THEORY

- The central spot carries 95% of the intensity for laser beams with Gaussian profile:  
  \( I = I_0 e^{-2(r / w)^2} \)  
  where \( e = 2.718 \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

- The radius of a Gaussian beam is defined as 0.135 times its peak value \( I_0 \). This radius is called the **spot size** and the spot diameter is \( w \).

- **Spot Diameter (d)** in microns:  
  \( d = f \cdot DA \)  
  where  
  \( f \) = Focal length of the lens (mm)  
  \( DA \) = Laser beam full divergence angle (mrad)

- For maximum coupling efficiency, the fiber core diameter must be larger than the spot diameter.

- **Numerical Aperture (NA) rays**:  
  \( NA = \frac{B.D. \cdot 2}{f} \)  
  where  
  \( B.D. \) = Laser Beam Diameter  
  \( f \) = Lens Focal Length

- The source coupler consists of two base plates:
  - One with a focusing lens and female connector receptacle.
  - The other attached to the laser.
  - An O-ring is sandwiched between them, held by threaded screws.
  - Angular orientation is adjusted using a screwdriver.

- **V-number** determines the number of modes:
  - If \( V < 2.045 \): Single Mode Fiber (HE11 or LP01 mode)
  - If \( V > 2.045 \): Multimode Fiber
    - Example: \( V = 4.91 \) → 4 LP modes propagate

## 🧪 PROCEDURE

1. Place the optical breadboard on a flat surface.
2. Mount the He-Ne laser source securely onto the breadboard.
3. Attach the laser to the fiber coupler mount, aligned with the laser exit.
4. Turn on the laser and align the beam spot centrally using the mount's travel adjustments.
5. Check for back reflection from the rod lens and adjust screws to redirect it into the laser exit.
6. Confirm central alignment using a white card; adjust if off-center.
7. Connect the multimode fiber patch cord to the coupler and secure the other end in the fiber holder.
8. Adjust the fiber tip height to ~50 mm above the white sheet.
9. Observe the multimode speckle pattern on the screen. Adjust screws to refine the pattern.
10. Replace with single mode fiber patch cord. Observe blur patterns of LP modes (e.g., single lobe, two lobes, etc.) by fine-tuning the coupler screws.

## 📊 OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION

- 
Parameter of given fiber are,
A = 4.5μm (core radius), N.A = 0.11, λ = 633nm V = 2 π x A x N.A / λ = 4.91
From fig. shows only 4 LP modes propagates.
Total number of modes = V2 / 2 = 4.912 / 2
